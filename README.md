Linked-reads, also called read clouds, are a powerful new datatype that blend many of the best capabilities of low cost accurate short reads sequencing with long read sequencing. Several high profile applications have been published using this new datatype, including GrocSV for highly accurate Structural Variation detection, SuperNova for de novo genome assembly, or HapCut2 for highly accurate phasing, each showing substantial improvements over regular short read sequencing. However, as impressive as these applications are, we feel more could be done from the academic community to further optimize methods for this type of data. To try to promote these developments, we are starting the Linked-reads Community Challenge (LRCC), a DREAM-like challenge to promote methods development. Under the LRCC, we will release a few linked-reads datasets to the community, so that different groups can contribute analysis results for evaluation. 

For the first community challenge, we are focusing on germline genome analysis, and the analysis will examine accuracy in SNP, indel, and SV calling, along with phasing and personalized phased genome construction. Our evaluation will include a few different approaches, including concordance to deep coverage PCR-free libraries, trios and larger pedigrees to look at Mendelian concordance, targeted resequencing over variants of interest, and potentially concordance to long read sequencing (PacBio and/or ONT). We are planning to release the data in two phases, first a few well known samples (NA12878, GIAB, etc) to establish the analysis protocols with ample training data, and then a set of novel genomes, ideally one or more multigenerational pedigrees with a disease focus. We are aiming to release the phase one dataset by the end of this year and then the phase two genomes early next.
